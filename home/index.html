        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> Hey! I'm James Pilcher. I like making things :)</p>
        <p> This is a personal website that holds some of the JS stuff i've made and archives my music.
            I've also started to blog - because the world needs more bloggers. In reality its to work on my writing
            speed + it acts as a nice little archive for my life. </p>
        <h2>The site</h2>
        This site was developed using boring old vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        <ul>
            <li>Fun</li>
            <li>Blog</li>
            <li>Music</li>
        </ul>
