# [My Personal Site](https://jamespilcher.github.io)

- 📝 A Blog 
- 🎨 Interactive Art (using JavaScript as a medium)
- 🎶 Information About My Music 


I'd like to add more, like a picture gallery and shortfilms section, but I don't want to over-complicate the site. At the moment, these sections are blog entries.

## Why?

I typically use the phrase "just above mundane" to describe the site.

The goal was to induce a sense of nostalgia and offer an engaging, widely accessible, site-wide experience that could captivate users in a unique way. It being a personal site, it's very "true to me" - simply put I find it cool and hope others do to.

You can tell from the design that the site is reminicant of the early-internet days. I like sharing the enjoyment that can come from simple human-computer interaciton, something that I feel is often overlooked these days.

## How?

Made from scratch in vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.

If you are curious, the navbar/footer is dynamically created by linking a JS file to each page.
