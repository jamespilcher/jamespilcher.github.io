                    <span class="albumdesc">This album draws inspiration from the renowned Old School RuneScape soundtrack, regarded as one of the greatest video game soundtracks ever created. By employing the distinctive soundfonts, I aimed to capture the charm of Ian Taylor's music. This project let me explore various techniques, including marching drums, circus-like melodies, and bossonova chord progresions.</span>

                    <span class="albumdesc">Track 1 sets a brooding and dark undertone, accompanied by eerie footsteps. The second track, a slowed-down rendition of my very first recording from my 16-year-old days, hits on the nostalgic feeling. Featuring drums borrowed from my broken Casio keyboard and chords played on first guitar, I'm considering releasing the original song as a James Pilcher track at its regular speed.</span>                </div>

                    <span class="albumdesc">The British Isles are home to the majority of the world's chalkstreams. The title track of this album showcases a recording captured from a camcorder near my local chalkstream - even my sniff is caught toward the end. Building upon the lessons learned from LCBTL, this album presents a refined and polished sound, incorporating darker and more intricate chord sequences.</span>

                    <span class="albumdesc">This track can be viewed as a bonus addition to LCBTL, given its creation during a similar timeframe. With a distinct use of electronic piano sounds, the song comprises a complete A and B section. Its composition evokes a sense of graceful chaos, as if the music is teetering on the edge before the first melody emerges, eliciting a strong emotional resonance.</span>                </div>

                    <span class="albumdesc">This release narrates the tale of a two-day camping excursion, indicated by the song titles. The music has a soothing simplicity while weaving in some intrigue, making it equally enjoyable for both active and passive listening experiences. Much like camping, theres a focus on nature throughout the album, with a strong use of foley to place the music. This album, while being my first, is the essence of my (jimbob's) music.</span>

Highlights are 'Claudia', 'One Day You'll Feel Great' and 'Mr Apeman - Bonus' which was made 1 year before the albums release! In my upcoming album, I plan to further explore this style while refining my lyrics to be more focused and clearer in their message.</span>

                    <span class="albumdesc"> I wrote this album after experiencing my first proper heart break! I know, poor 17 year old me. The album offers very raw, emotional yet surreal lyrics - similar in style to Jeff Mangum from Neutral Milk Hotel. 'you make me pee all the time' is a highlight on the EP. It's about first date nerves and the honeymoon period of a relationship. I've since taking this off streaming platforms, as my singing wasn't great in places and it isn't the direction I want the rest of my music to go in. Its still available on youtube as a time-capsule.</span>
