            This Sunday, I was going to write about ‘Communication During Sexual Encounters’. That topic is a bit
            delicate and heavy, and I’m not in the mood right now, so SCRATCH THAT! Last night, I played in a
            blues/folk jam at a bookshop (really fun btw), so I’ll go with something lighter and family-friendly:
            ‘Climbing Cringe Mountain’. This is a concept that I’ve felt quite deeply throughout my life and I
            hadn’t really thought to ever verbalise it. Semi-recently, I came across a TikTok (the worlds favourite
            medium) that encapsulated the concept well.

            Sometimes to get to the Land of Cool, you have to climb Cringe Mountain. I’ve heard the phrase “Don’t be
            afraid to be seen trying” which conveys a similar sentiment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the past month or two, I’ve started going to music sessions and playing a few songs. Before coming to
            Tokyo, I played proper live music twice (as in two songs). The second time was much better than the first -
            I think because I had the lyrics out in front of me. That’s one thing that’s worth keeping in mind when
            hiking the mountain… don’t forget your hiking sticks. Having played a few more songs, I'm definitely more
            confident now. By being public with your cringe, 1. You pick up skills from those around you and 2. You are
            more eager to learn by getting immediate feedback (and hopefully support). This makes getting to the Land of
            Cool quicker! In the case of music, it forces me to play different genres and improve my timing. Remember
            that it can be good for you to occasionally play in one division higher than you should. That said, always
            be humble and self-aware. Don’t act like you are hot shit if you are just shit! Act like a funny poop joke
            instead.

            With this topic, I might be speaking from a place of privilege. I don’t know if it's because I’m British or
            what, but I’ve always had a very high cringe tolerance. I embrace it with loving arms. So, a word of
            warning: climbing Cringe Mountain might be easier for me than for others. I’ve always been eager to try new
            things. Just an example, I released my first (singing) EP when I was 17. The singing was rough in places. I
            have since deleted it from Spotify (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUn2JzOYpBw&ab_channel=JamesPilcher">it’s still up on YT</a>) but looking back on it, I still think it's really
            cool I did it and I wouldn’t be where I am today without it. It really is a superpower to not care when
            faced with a Cringe Mountain. The more cringe mountains you conquer, the easier life is when faced with a new one.
        <p>
            Also keep in mind, depending on the subject and your skill set, sometimes Cringe Mountain is just a gentle
            slope, and at times, you might even find yourself naturally born into the Land of Cool for certain things.
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember, people in the Land of Cool will look back at those climbing with support and enthusiasm - and
            maybe with a little smirk, it’s like watching a drunk friend pretending to act sober. Also, always be aware
            that the first time you think you have made it out of Cringe Mountain, you likely haven’t – you've probably
            landed in Dunning Kruger Divot. That sounds like a Fortnite location.
        </p>

            Learning new skills is so important. I really recommend throwing yourself into something and giving it some
            effort (even 50%), knowing that only good can come from it. Don’t be afraid to fail. I used to think
            University was unique in the fact that there are so many opportunities but after moving to Tokyo, I’ve
            realised that in most urban areas there will always be community events and classes to join in on - you just
            have to find them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next year, I’m going to try improv classes for the following reasons: 1. I like being silly and witty. 2. I
            think it will help with my limited public speaking ability.
