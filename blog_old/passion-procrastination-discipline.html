        <p>
            Fittingly, I am writing this less than an hour before my bedtime. In my life, I consider myself very lucky.
            Excluding my race, gender, nationality, entire socio-economic background, and a dozen other things, I’m
            lucky because I’m a naturally driven individual. This is good because I am not well disciplined, at least in
            certain scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m applying to internships at the moment and there are/will be coding interview questions. So, I was
            studying ‘Leetcode’, a site that facilitates learning these styles of questions, after work every day for
            about a week or so. My feed was showing clips from Leetcode, and I had a genuine interest in it… and then I
            just stopped. I’m not sure why. I still want to work for Spotify.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think the issue lies in not having clear goals. When it’s exam season, I am a very disciplined individual.
            I will spend 6 hours a day studying, no problem, and that’s because I know, at the end of things, there will
            be a clear numeric value on my performance. Most things in life don’t have that, and that’s why it's hard to
            be disciplined.
        </p>
        <p>
            I might be echoing very basic self-help I’ve heard throughout my life, but thinking now, the answer probably
            lies somewhere in:
            <ul>
                <li>Having a clear goal.</li>
                <li>Having clear metrics on progress.</li>
                <li>Being consistent.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            Starting the Sunday Journal Club is another solution to this. I wanted a means to practice writing, but I
            know myself well enough that in order to see it through, I must create a whole framework that makes it more
            appealing. This is the same reason I deliberately guide my feed toward certain topics (like Leetcode) when I
            want to pursue something. It’s like weaponising your identity for productivity’s sake. Which I think is an
            interesting tactic, and I see it A LOT in entrepreneurial types, which can be very funny, yet tragic, at
            times.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can rationalize putting things off pretty easily. My core logic is “I’ll do this when I am more in the
            mood to do this,” i.e., waiting for passion to arrive. And normally it does! I’ll do the washing up once I’m
            like, “Hey, I want to do the washing up.” But the rest of the time, I’m in this state where I’m sat in my
            room, and the washing's not done. Yes, this is a metaphor.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, I don’t have a good argument against waiting to do something until you're in the mood for it (or
            are driven to do it by circumstance). I guess one would be that over a longer period of time, your life will
            be better if you tackle things earlier? Not sold on this entirely yet, mainly because I just thought of it
            and haven’t thought it through… Ironically, the thing about relying on passion, is you don’t really have a
            desire, <i>or the passion</i>, to dismantle that mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
            The biggest takeaway for me is that I should apply more metrics to my life and work, no matter what my
            desire is to do so.
