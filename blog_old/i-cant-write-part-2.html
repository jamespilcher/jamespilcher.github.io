        <h2>Context</h2>
        This is an edit of a 15 minute stream of conciousness: <a href="i-cant-write.html">I Don't Know How to Write
            [Draft]</a>.
        Read that if you want to face my unthought-out thoughts. There is also a debrief at the end of this page, which
        I wrote as soon as I finished the edit.
        <h2>The Edit</h2>
        <p>
            <i>We are going to get a little meta here.</i>
        </p>

            Recently, while learning how to hold chopsticks properly, I discovered I don't hold pens properly. This was
            a scathing metaphore for my writing ability. For this piece, 'piece' sounds rather romantic, I am editing a
            15 minute stream of conciousness I wrote earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Part 1: My struggles with writing</b> <br><br>
            I view writing as a form of entertainment, and subsequently a victim of iteration. The question is how often
            should you edit? I see each and every sentence as a puzzle piece that can fit optimally in a larger
            narrative, where you
            have to perfectly time it's rhythm and delivery. I painstakingly try to solve this problem on the fly so it
            takes me far too long to write. I've been painfully aware of how
            this approach holds me back since secondary school. It's like solving a complex optimisation problem using
            guestimation. A very tedious task indeed.
        </p>
        <p>
            So what am I optimising for? Well, as established, entertainment but more specifically, insight, emotion,
            and narrative.
            The three biggies. Like, "Ooo, look at how insightful and engaging that commentary
            was." The problem is, for certain topics, you're just not born with insight. You have to, you know,
            educate yourself. Luckily, this blog is largely about my experiences and my introspection - but that doesn't
            account for the 'narrative kicker' I desperately search for. I think the truth is that, that
            'narrative kicker' or 'take home idea' isn't actually important to writing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another issue I've found is that I don't tend to "think in words"; most of the time, I have no internal
            dialogue. I think that
            generally, makes it harder to articulate things, especially things that, to me, seem intuitive. Improving in
            this area is one of my goals, and I think I am certainly better than I used to be, which is nice to see.
            As an additional point, I didn't read much as a kid so that doesn't help.
        <p>
            <b>Part 2: Why know how to write?</b> <br><br>
            Or should it say 'Why no how to write?' Haha - because I can't. Oh but I can! I've always gotten
            OKAY-DECENT grades in essay subjects, and I've always been told my writing voice is unique - in a positive
            way, not in a "Oh he's... unique..." way.
            I like the way I write, largely because I try desperately to write something I'd find interesting, funny,
            and engaging. I
            don't understand how people don't do this and at the same time I wish I could not write like this.
        </p>
        <p>
            To answer the original question, we need to go back to 'the optimisation problem'. The core issue
            is the time-output ratio. I want to improve my guestimator
            and worry less about finding the 'perfect' answer. I want to be able to write 90% as
            good as my current writing and 300% faster. While that might be an ambitious goal, it's a cause worth
            fighting for!
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Part 3: Other thoughts!</b> <br><br>
            My handwriting SUCKS. This is because 95% of the time when I write in pen, it is 'just for me'. Also, I'm
            sure holding the pen incorrectly doesn't help. But then I take an exam, and all of my bad habits catch up
            with me. Like who'd have thought that by practicing my "dead
            spider's crawl" (what my german teacher described my writing as) that I'd have poor handwriting!? Fun fact
            about why girls generally have nicer handwriting: it's because they have finer muscle control at a younger
            age when compared with boys. Due to slower male development, boys tend to pick up bad habits as they are
            practicing with poorer motor control. I think that's pretty interesting. I'm not sure if that's true, but
            I'm pretty sure I heard it somewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was seeing a girl recently, and she showed me her notebook. She writes almost every day and she was very
            articulate (and had pretty handwriting). Not necessarily fancy words-articulate, just very good at
            communicating what she means. I wish I was naturally like that and had those habits. Maybe once I've learned
            how to write I'll learn how to hold chopsticks...
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Part 4: Conclusion - The Tedium of the Medium</b> <br><br>
            The conclusion doesn't really apply much anymore, but I'll go off-piste and give you my thoughts. I have spent a total of 1 hour 25 minutes on this edit and to be frank, I've found
            this mildly frustrating. I think next time I'll stick to the 15 minutes, then spend another 15 minutes
            editing using chatGPT. Realistically, I have a very similar narrative voice - I think it's just the grammar and the
            EXTRA CLUNKY phrases that need work. This was a fun experiment to do though!</p>
        <h2>Post-edit Debrief</h2>
        <p>This post was about 830 words. That's pretty good for the time (for me!). From now on I'll do a '15 minute blogpost' where I spend 15 minutes writing and 15 minutes editing. I did really enjoy the 15 minute stream of conciousness. I want to talk more about motivation vs dedication... that will be my next 15 minute blogpost! Also, "Tedium of the Medium" is too good to be ignored...</p>
