appears and you can quickly place
lots of blocks at once

when you hold q and hold right click a red grid
appears and u can quickly delete lots of blocks

take a pixel from the middle top of the block. make a rectangle of that colour. maybe diamond shape canvas

green background, maybe just a colour
referencing the heigh of the block.
