        <p> I was prompted to write this by an email we received from our University guild. For context, I run <b>The
                Society About Computers</b> at Exeter Uni. Here's the email:</p>

        <i>
            <p>Computing or Computer Science?</p>
            <p>Hi Computing Society,

                We're auditing society email addresses and reflecting that your email address doesn't match your
                society's name, i just wanted to check if this was something you'd like updating at all?

                If you have any questions, please let me know.

                Best wishes, [guild staff member]
            </p>

        <p>4 years ago our society was called
            <b>EXE.CSS</b>, the EXEter Computer Science Society. Personally, objectively, I HATE this name, but it
            clearly
            has some support: a friend said they'd only vote
            for me if I promise to change the name back. It's the perfect name for an
            outdated CSS library. In fact, its the perfect name for a shady file extension you see when you are 11 years
            old and trying to download minecraft for free. (I may have infected my dads old computer with a lot of
            viruses doing this...)
        </p>
        <p>This has to be an issue for nerds around the english speaking world. Computer Science Society. CSS. Cascading
            Style Sheets. CSS. Computer Science Society. CS. Computing Society. The River Exe. Computer Science. CS.
            EXE. Exeter. Computer Science. CS. GoLang. CSGO?!?
        </p>
        <p> Nowadays, we go by <b>EXCS</b>, the Exeter Computing Society. I like the name, I think it rolls off the tongue nicely and we
            have a nice logo. The only problem is that CS more commonly refers to Computer Science and our course is
            called Computer Science. Some people are surprised when I tell them its actually the <i>computing</i>
            society. I
            don't really mind what they call it (as long as its not EXE.CSS) but its awkward to pick between the two
            when choosing an official name.
        <p> There's not really much more to say. To end on zinger, John F. Kennedy once said "Forgive your enemies, but
            never forget their names".</p>
        <p> This has no relevance >:)</p>
