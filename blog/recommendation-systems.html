        <h2>
            1. Introduction
        </h2>
        <p>What people consume (sometimes literally) is directly influenced by computer-generated suggestions. From
            finding love to finding breakup songs, multi-billion dollar companies utilise recommendation systems (RSs)
            to drive user engagement and ad revenue. This essay will delve into the mechanics, challenges, and potential
            improvements of recommendation systems, while briefly touching on the ethical implications surrounding
            certain uses.</p>
        <p>So, what are recommendation systems? If I were talking to a 5-year-old I’d explain it like so:</p>
        <i>Recommendation systems are like friendly robots that suggest things you might like based on what you have
            liked before.</i>
        <p>If you are above the age of 5, first of all, congratulations, and secondly, let’s go a step further. A RS
            generally consists of 3 parts [1]:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Collecting data about user behaviour, such as search queries, purchase history, or viewing habits.</li>

            <li>the collected data using algorithms or machine learning techniques to gauge user preferences and
                interests.</li>

            <li>Use these interests to recommend items that they are likely to enjoy based on their past behaviour.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This technology has found widespread use across various industries: it’s the driving force behind Amazon’s
            Things You Might Like Section, Spotify’s Daily Mixes, and Instagram’s Explore Page. These are the go-to,
            intuitive examples but there are more intriguing applications. For instance, they can help determine a
            person’s desired travel destinations, food preferences on food delivery apps, and even identify what kind of
            people a person may be interested in for online dating. The (arguably sneaky) influence RSs have on our
            day-to-day lives can’t be understated. We’ll touch more on this later when discussing echo chambers,
            addiction, and targeted advertising but for now, let’s consider why RSs are so beneficial.</p>
        <i>“Getting information off the internet is like taking a drink from a fire hydrant.”</i> - Mitchell Kapor

        <p>Before utilising effective information filtering, online services were bloated with content resulting in
            users facing information overload. Additionally, consumers could only rely on personal recommendations from
            a small circle of friends and family [2]. Recommendation systems, sometimes known as “information filtering
            systems”, aim to resolve these issues, and ultimately give companies a better understanding of their
            customers. Let’s explore the two major paradigms [3].</p>

        <h2>
            2. What Changed?
        </h2>
        <h3>
            2.1. Content-Based Filtering (CBF)
        </h3>
        <p>Content-based filtering involves analyzing the attributes of items, or their “content”, to suggest other
            items that are similar to those that the user has previously liked [4]. A user may “like” an item by
            engaging with it for an extended period of time, making a purchase, or visiting it repeatedly. Conversely,
            they may “dislike” an item if they skip past it quickly or return a product. Additionally, users may
            explicitly give their preferences on items (or certain types of items) through rating systems, or a
            like/dislike system. CBF stands out for its speed and scalability, as it does not rely on other users’
            information and therefore requires less memory. Additionally, it can capture a user’s niche interests that
            only appeal to a small audience. However, this feature is symptomatic of a broader challenge with
            content-based filtering: it relies on pre-existing interests to make new recommendations leading to a
            limited capacity to expand user interests.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the attributes of items are hand-selected (to an extent) which can be a limiting factor in the
            quality of recommendations as it is difficult to account for every feature.</p>

        <h3> 2.2 Collaborative filtering (CF)</h3>
        <p>So how can collaborative filtering address the issues in CBF? David Goldberg, who coined the term
            “Collaborative Filtering” with Tapestry (a mail filtering system) in 1992, believed that incorporating other
            humans into the filtering process would improve these systems [5]. This approach uses similarities between
            users in order to generate new recommendations [6].</p>
        <p>A simple music streaming application is an ideal use case for collaborative filtering as it can quickly
            exhaust the number of quantifiable attributes available for analysis. For example, two songs may have a
            similar key, bpm, and genre, but one could be Adele pouring her heart out while the other is a Kidz Bop
            cover of Adele pouring her heart out. In reality, streaming services will likely use a hybrid of the CF and
            CBF which we will explore in the next section.</p>
        <p>Another benefit is that users can now discover new interests - if someone similar to you likes something, you
            will probably like it too. In Tapestry’s case, users were able to annotate documents, which allowed for
            filtering based on personalized preferences using customized queries like “Retrieve all emails related to
            recommendation systems that Rosie enjoyed”.</p>
        <p>For comparison’s sake here are the pros and cons of each filtering system:</p>


        <table cellspacing="20px">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>RS</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>Pros</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>Cons</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>CBF</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>Only need to store details of the individual items. Simple to implement</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>Does not expand user interests. Have to hand-select item attributes.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>CF</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>Expands user interests. No hand-selected item attributes.</p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>More storage required. More complex to implement efficiently.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Additionally, both of these methods suffer from the “cold start problem”, where its difficult to recommend
            items to new users. This problem is usually reduced by making the user explicitly state their preferences on
            sign-up.</p>

        <h2>3. What Now? </h2>
        <p>Starting with e-commerce, industries started to realise the business value of good recommendations. In the
            late 1990s, Amazon launched their collaborative filtering method, successfully increasing their sales.
            Computing power increased, and companies began to invest a significant amount of time and resources into
            research in the field, which ultimately led to the development and adoption of hybrid RSs.</p>
        <p>Essentially a catch-all term, hybrid RSs are any filtering system that utilises aspects from both CF and CBF
            so that their shortcomings counteract one another [7]. It can also involve incorporating other strategies
            like heuristics, weightings, or machine learning to enhance their performance and quality. By leveraging
            these additional techniques, hybrid RSs surpass the capabilities of pure CF/CBF [8]. It is the norm for each
            company to implement their own proprietary hybrid recommendation system(s). Let’s use Netflix as a case
            study for the current state of RSs when used in industry.</p>
        <p>It utilises CF by comparing your preferences to those of similar users, and CBF by using item-specific
            information such as the year and genre of a show or movie to guide new recommendations. Additionally, the
            system takes into account contextual factors such as the time of day and how recently you watched a certain
            show to fine-tune its suggestions. Unique to Netflix, they have staff that watch films and assign them
            microtags as metadata. This is then used to automatically categorise TV shows and films into over 70,000
            microgenres: “Gory Foreign Satanic Stories” and “Understated Romantic Road Trip Movies” to name two. These
            microgenres can be used to make even more niche, user-specific recommendations. To stress the importance of
            a good RS, 80% of TV shows people watch on Netflix are discovered through its recommendation system [9].</p>

        <h2>4. What the Future Might Look Like</h2>
        <p>Social media platforms featuring short-form content, such as TikTok and Instagram use RSs to produce an
            endless stream of personalized entertainment. However, this can result in addiction and other negative
            mental health outcomes, such as low self-esteem [10][11]. Given that a majority of users are young, it
            remains unclear what the long-term impacts will be.</p>
        <p>Filter bubbles occur on social media when a users feed becomes increasingly homogenous, which can be directly
            caused by the RS. This can have two negative consequences: it inhibits a user’s ability to explore new
            interests, and, more insidiously, it rejects outside opinion and only reinforces pre-existing biases leading
            to potentially harmful effects on the user’s perception of reality [12]. Political campaigns have exploited
            filter bubbles by using targeted ads or fake accounts to manipulate public opinion, creating division and
            threatening democracy [13]. To combat this, social media companies and governments must cooperate to promote
            transparency, and media literacy, and lawmakers must regulate political advertising.</p>
        <p>Finally, The privacy risks involved with gathering and processing data are often overlooked. [14] The vast
            quantity of user data, makes them a tempting target for potential cyber-attacks. Consequently, there have
            been calls for stronger legislation to regulate the gathering and storage of this data to better protect
            user privacy and security.
        </p>
        <p>We are heading in a direction of more data, more computation, and more intelligent means of analysis (through
            AI) and there’s no doubt that these systems will improve. Additionally, the areas in which RSs will apply
            continue to expand. As an example, in the future, RSs may be used to suggest appropriate physiotherapy
            routines [15]. Legislation must continue to try and keep up with the influence modern RSs hold, and ensure
            that they are used in a way that is beneficial to the general population.</p>
