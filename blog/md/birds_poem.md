## Birds Poem
*10/03/24*

The reeds squashed beneath my steps,  
Binoculars wrapped around my neck,  
A bird book, stuffed into my shorts,  
*I know exactly what I'm looking for.*  

Drifted through the blue,  
Wind, air, nothing new,  
Some specs of dust, here and there,  
But all animals absent from the air.  

With hope, I pulled lenses to my eyes,  
Looked through and paused;  
Far away appeared,  
A great hue soaring through the skies.  

It was unlike anything I'd seen.  
Beautiful blotches of light upon its wings.  
I reached to my pocket,  
Flipped through the pages and scribbled:  
*What a being!*  
*Warm, beneficial.*  

Raining now, closing the book,  
Lensless I looked back up to see,  
Wind, air, nothing new,  
Some clouds, all empty.  

Stuttering, I pulled the lenses once more:  
*There the being,*  
*I saw before.*  

Opportunity, Respect,  
Dignity, Death,  
Vast scenarios implanted in my head,  
Progress, Laughter,  
Care, and Hope,  
All to be risen by the sight in my scope.  

*Hm, but it's awfully static.*  
My head trickled,  
Shoulders became wet,  
I turned my vision, still through the lens,  
The bird tracked too effortlessly, immovably,  
A glooming movement bloomed upon me.  

Some refractive gunk,  
Resting on the binoculars,  
Was wiped away by a droplet.  
And went with it the being,  
As the being was it,  
Nothing more than a projection of spit.
