## Sticks Poem
*18/02/24*

A pair, a couple, a duet of sticks,  
Lay bear, naked, still with bliss.  
In my mind these twigs entwined,  
Signed soothing preceding stories,  
Moving, soaring.

Two dogs perhaps,  
Mouths full of wood,  
Playfully comparing, panting,  
Dancing in the way dogs do.

Remnants of a great epic,  
An adolescent duo duelling,  
Nature caressed the swords,  
That left make-believe blood pooling.

Or were they staffs,  
Crafted by wizards from the past,  
Casted from spirit, tree, wet grass?

In-a-pinch ski sticks?  
A giant's giant-sized toothpicks?  
Mother-daughter, father-son?  
Old lovers' laughter, a chapter closing and done?

Whatever the story, tale, universe,  
They still found one another,  
Afterall, it is the present that matters.
