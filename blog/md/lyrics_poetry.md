## Lyrics/Poetry
*31/12/23*

Here are some lyrics from some songs I've been writing/recording as of
late. I hope to complete an album worth of songs (and a discard-album
worth of, admittedly weirder, songs). I think the album will be called
'Really Sweet', and the discard-album will be called 'Really Weird
(Really Sweet Outtakes)'. Anyway, here are some lyrics I've written, and
some background on them.

**Have Grown**

These lyrics came out of the frustration that came from work stifling my
spontaneous inspiration. In the past, every couple days, I would wake up
around 9, start writing a song (or work on a map, or do XYZ), and
wouldn't stop until 3 or 4pm. Now I'm a working man, this magic is gone.
I've forever lost access to 5/7ths of potential random-inspiration days.
It's upsetting. In the song there are other themes of growing up, and
responsibility. I really like this song! I hope people will enjoy it
once it's out. Appropriately, the backing for this song was recorded
about 3 years ago now, and has two guitars with one pitched down a bit.

**Belly Button at Sunrise**

Name is undecided, but I refuse to publicly call any creative work
'Untitled'. I guess this is a meta-song of some of the things I like in
relationships (even short-term sexual ones). The main theme of this song
is being gross with someone as a form of intimacy. I really love that.
Picking someone else\'s nose. Biting someone else's butt. It's nice.
It's silly. It's a must-have for me. I've never heard a song about it
(probably because the lyrics would be gross...) so I thought I'd write
one. Fair warning, in this song, the lyrics are definitely secondary to
the music and were much less thought-out than the previous, but that
element of spontaneity is a core part of the message.

> give me a second it\'s not clear,
>
> why your running down through here,
>
> 'cus im so sick of this
>
> won\'t you give me one more kiss?
>
> see i think you\'re really sweet,

>
> your nose off
>
> i love your big old nose
>
> let me lick your crooked toes
>
> and the gunk between your teeth,
>
> it's all beautiful to me,
>
> it\'s all lovely to my eyes,
>
> belly button at sunrise,
>
> shines brighter than the stars,
>
> and i loved you from the start
>
> see me heart is open,
>
> my arms are cold,
>
> wont you a little come closer,
>
> before we are old,
>
> i remember what you said
>
> that precious night,
>
> never be afraid to,
>
> get in a fight

**Flung**

This song is kind of sad, kind of raw, kind of overly-self pitying. It
was written as a self-indulging piece about me being sick of romantic
endeavours that don't work out for one reason or another. It's a nice
track and the music itself supports it well. It ends with a whimsical
flute.

> credit to myself, i think i am awesome,
>
> but im starting to think im uniquely proportioned,
>
> because i can\'t seem to find a fit for me
>
> a series of flings makes me start to think weak
>
> i want to be flung me off the edge of the world,
>
> so i won\'t have to think
>
> about another girl
>
> it\'s not smooth,
>
> its rough,
>
> am i enough,
>
> are you? im not sure.
>
> i wish my worth could come entirely from within
>
> intimacy in fleeting circumstances
>
> i think i have a lot of love to give,
>
> i should start giving more inwardly

**Sally and Charlie**

This song is about a breakdown of a relationship, largely caused by one
anxious partner and one avoidant partner. The little conversation they
have in the second section that's performed by one narrative voice (in
the song, me), almost stumbling over itself has a nice effect. I think
this song is very 'real' and I like the high level concept of it.

> sally and charlie are stuck again,
>
> charlie says i'll love you till the end,
>
> while sally receded into herself,
>
> so charlie just sat there, staring at the shelf,
>
> looking at the books,
>
> emblematic of their life,
>
> dogeared diaries,
>
> wuthering heights,
>
> with worrying lows,
>
> foundations of sand,
>
> it\'s a beach day,
>
> burnt by the hand,
>
> of love.
>
> there are fundamental differences, we\'re stuck with them now
>
> no charlie i\'m not sure i can keep going round,
>
> this old conversation - i keep getting tired,
>
> maybe you wouldn\'t if you stopped being quiet.
>
> i\'ve said everything that i want to say,
>
> we keep on fighting, at the end of the day,
>
> we all deserve peace with someone,
>
> and we are not the ones\...
>
> for each other
>
> oh sweet sally,
>
> i\'m not a gambling man
>
> we played card games,
>
> and were burnt by the hand,
>
> of worrying lows,
>
> foundations of sand,
>
> it\'s a beach day,
>
> and were by the hand,
>
> of oh sweet sally,
>
> i\'m not a gambling man
>
> we played card games,
>
> and were burnt by the hand,
>
> of worrying lows,
>
> foundations of sand,
>
> it\'s a beach day,
>
> burnt by the hand,
>
> of love.
>
> they played card games,
>
> and were burnt by the hand,
>
> of love.

I'd like to add some more lyrics, but I'm a bit over time and need to go
anyway. I'm really looking forward to this album! It's quite folky and
cute (hence 'Really Sweet'). Hope you appreciated this, please feel free
to comment! Curious, and intrigued, as to how they are read as
stand-alone poetry without the music behind them. I can't unhear the
associated melodies in my head.
