## Limbs Poem
*24/02/24*

Sprouting from an egg,  
Came a rich neck-like stem,  
Piercing the once wintry ash.  

Written in itâ€™s sweet blood,  
A provocation, from somewhere above, read:  
Be the first limb reaching,  
To create the great green ceiling.  

More veiny creatures were birthed,  
All gazing upward, eyes sleepy-dusted by dirt.  
The earth below felt rope-like legs grow,  
A needling movement, subtle, but known.  

Bit by bit, as limbs grew limbs,  
A stillness rose from within,  
Things were lively and ready,  
Steady nests, warm sunlight, supplies supple and plenty,  
But bit by bit,  
A stillness rose from within.  

Then friction.  
Tension.  

The limbs that grew limbs grew new limbs,  
Twisting, turning, bending aloud,  
The oldest monster thick, tense, and grand,  
As were its rivals.  

A shimmering of hands shut out the sun,  
Some simmering suppressants, ineffective and blunt,  
Crevices filled and resources thinned,  
While soil dried, weak and limp.  

With indifference, a spark splintered,  
Careening down, causing a coarse orange flicker.  
Warm light stumbled through the black,  
Wide walls crumbled, creaked, and snapped.  
The illuminating flaming bodies,  
With their heads melting, limbs falling,  
Lungs burning from a seizure of smoke,  
Were all consumed, erased, and choked.  

Everything eventually fell motionless, still, flat, and dead.  
Then, wriggling somewhere deep in the soil, a message read:  
It was covertly beautiful,  
The life we lived, the lights we left,  
The admittedly horrible demising distress,  
Because here beneath the coal and turf,  
We have surviving seeds absent from hurt.  
Slightly different, slightly unique, waiting for room to grow,  
Now they too can reach upward,  
Surface,  
And have their go.
