## Found Poetry
*02/06/24*

*Found poetry is a type of poetry created by taking words, phrases, and
sometimes whole passages from other sources and reframing them (a
literary equivalent of a collage\[1\]) by making changes in spacing and
lines, or by adding or deleting text, thus imparting new meaning. The
resulting poem can be defined as treated: changed in a profound and
systematic manner; or untreated: virtually unchanged from the order,
syntax and meaning of the poem.

I will create two poems from the following sources

1.  [Beatles: First Radio Interview, 10/28/1962](http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/db1962.1028.beatles.html)

2.  [The Present and Future: Ethan Hawke on "The Before Trilogy"](https://www.rogerebert.com/interviews/the-present-and-future-ethan-hawke-on-the-before-trilogy)

### **Group Meeting Nerves** 
***(phrases taken from Beatles: First Radio Interview, 10/28/1962)***

*I know their names,*  
*and I\'m going to try and put faces to them.*  

\"what do you do?"  
"busy at all?\"
"You\'re new to the group, 
aren\'t you"  

*dead nervous*  
*that\'s me. Yeah.*  
we heard afterwards.  
But, strangely enough, it didn\'t come to us.  

We didn\'t think at all about that.  

### **Trouble** 
***(phrases taken from The Present and Future: Ethan Hawke on "The Before Trilogy")***

And for some reason I did last night,  
and I'm trying to process it too.  

reversed  
breathtakingly horrible.  
awful.  
fucking "Moonlight"  
a big deal  

my belief  
at the time was so strong  
it would have surprised me,  
to be honest.  

You know, I was used to my friend  
a feeling of like,  
"Well, this is special."  
my own gut isn't so crazy.  
Did that change  

that was how I left that experience:
changed
