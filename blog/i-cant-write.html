        <h2>Context</h2>
        This was 15 minute stream of conciousness. <a href="i-cant-write-part-2.html">I Don't Know How to Write
            [Edited]</a> is the same text that has undergone an edit. Read that for my thought-out thoughts. There's a
        quick debrief at the end of this page, which I wrote as soon as I finished.
        <h2>Draft - read at your own peril...</h2>
        <p>
            We are going to get a little meta here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Recently, while learning how to hold chopsticks properly, I learnt I don't hold pens properly.
            Emblamatically, I feel like I can't write properly either. As in narratively.
            For this piece, ('piece' makes it sound musical almost), I've set a 15 minute timer, after which I will go
            back and edit. I've allowed some edits for now - typo's and the like.

        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Part 1: Why Can't I write?</b> <br><br>
            I think I struggle too much with narrative structure and engaging sentences. So before writing, I'm crafting
            some sort of narrative that will be engaging. See how I've naturally leaned
            into dividing this blogpost into parts? Interesting isn't it. The second issue is that I want to craft each
            sentence, and have each sentence, fit perfectly within it's paragraph and surroundings.
            This leads to it feeling like clunky problem solving. I think I'm a bit of a maximilist in life, i.e will
            spend a very long time researching and plannign opportunities and that plays out in my wriitng.
            For this blogpost you can still see its very much stream of conciousness.
            Another issue I find is that I also want to focus on having some insight to give? This plays into that
            'entertainment' aspect. I want to share knowledge and insight emotion in the reader. Like ooo look at
            how insightful that commentary was. I think I could give my self more credit that the stuff I write
            naturally can be interesting.

            the third and final issue I find is that, I don't tend to "think in words". My thoughts are quite abstract,
            and most of the time I have no internal dialogue. I also didn't read much as a kid so that doesn't help
            .
            But back to the "think in words", yeah it makes it hard when I am trying to articulate, and I wish I can be
            more immediate with my resolutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Part 2: Why know how to write?</b> <br><br>
            or should I say 'Why no how to write?' Because I cant. But i can! Maybe i can. I've always gotten
            OKAY-DECENT grades in english, and my current writing system gets me good feedback, and I think its
            generally interesting
            The issue is the time-output ratio. I want to be able to be 90% as good as my current writing and 300%
            faster. That might be an ambitious goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Part 3: Other thoughts!</b> <br><br>
            My handwriting SUCKS. This is because 95% of the time when I write in pen, it is 'just for me'. It doesn't
            need to look good or be readable. but then I take an exam, and that all changes. All this practicing a "dead
            spiders crawl"
            (what my german teacher described my writing as) actually seems detrimental.
            I was seeing a girl recently, and she showed me her notebook. She writes almost every day and she was very
            articulate. Not necessarily fancy words-articulate, just very good at communicating what she means.
            I wish I could do that better. So here we are. 3 minutes to go.
        </p>

            <b>Part 4: Conclusion</b> <br><br>
            Okay with these 2.5 mins, how have I found this experience? Interesting, It's felt like how i communicate
            with friends, only more focus on me... obviously. Im excited to see how much I have written, and excited for
            you to see the final version!
            I'll post both, one pre draft and one post draft. I have my dissertation coming up... this should be good
            practice.
            Hopefully I do this more. This will be a good way of logging whats going on in my life. Maybe if I do the
            before and after I will become a better writer. Im at a time in my life where I want to (and need to!) get
            better at things, and try new things.
            Maybe I should do this once a week. Each morning? set a time? I'm not sure. Im so often driven by motivation
            and not dedicatino. Its one of my flaws for sure. But luckily I have lots of motivation naturally. Okay that
            should do it. See you in the near future!
        </p>
        <h2>Immediate Debrief</h2>
        <p>Wow. I wrote 679 words. It probably all sucks, but wow. Very surpised and pleased.</p>
