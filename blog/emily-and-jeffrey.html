Also the genre is notoriously tricky to write about (plot holes and the like).

The little coffee shop was owned by a little old woman called Margaret. She was lovely. As it happened, today it would become very special to two little humans. One was a fair-haired and fairly lonely woman called Emily. She was in her late 20s and was a museum curator. The other was Jeffrey who was also in his late-20s and was a journalist, not fair-haired (brown-haired in fact) but still fairly lonely.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Over the last month or so, they coincidentally visited the coffee shop at the same time, same day, each week and were becoming decent friends from these regular encounters. This one was their fifth.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">It was 4pm on a Tuesday, early autumn, and the shop was mostly empty. Jeffrey approached the glass door and saw Emily already sitting in the &lsquo;command position&rsquo; at the back left corner of the room, next to some plants. Emily appreciates a good place to sit, as does Jeffrey. After the bell-chime of Jeffrey walking in, Emily looked up and saw him. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;You again!&rdquo; she said while waving endearingly. Unfortunately, her table only had enough room for one.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Helloo!&rdquo; Jeffrey waved back.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Hiii.&quot; said Peter, the only other customer.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">They didn&#39;t know Peter. In fact, Peter would die of a heart attack in a few days and would never be seen in public again. Jeffrey nodded at him warmly with a slight smirk and walked towards the counter.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Caffe latte please.&rdquo; He always wondered if the &lsquo;Caffe&rsquo; in &lsquo;Caffe Latte&rsquo; was like &lsquo;This is a cafe&rsquo; or like &lsquo;Caffeine&rsquo;. He obviously didn&rsquo;t care that much, because he never looked it up. He finished ordering and waited longer than he should have to; while the barista was human, they were disappointingly sluggish in their work. Jeffrey accepted this as being good for him, as he&rsquo;d often find himself frustrated when things were done inefficiently and figured he needed to practise patience. He considered it exposure therapy. &nbsp;Jeffrey picked up his beverage and sat down.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Emily and Jeffrey were now a few tables away from one another, both doing their respective &#39;things&#39;, pick any two of: reading, writing, web-browsing, web-shopping, studying, doodling, researching, curating, dancing, kayaking.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">12 minutes in, Jeffrey, bored with his &lsquo;thing&rsquo;, &nbsp;looked around and then paused. The shadows were wrong, different from when he arrived. It was slightly too bright. As confused as he was, he found some solace as he had a question for Emily. He raised his hand, realised that was weird so looked toward Emily instead, trying to catch her eye. He often tried to do that, failing more often than not. Emily looked over.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&quot;Hey, have the windows moved?&quot; questioned Jeffrey, in a manner more serious than Emily was used to.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&quot;?&quot; said Emily&#39;s face, sneering playfully. Her smile was brief though&mdash;the windows had not only moved, but changed shape also.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c8">&quot;Gosh, you are right. They are different.&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1"></a></sup></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c8">That&#39;s when somebody Yelped&mdash;as in, submitted a rating on the commonly used review platform Yelp.com: </span><span class="c8 c16">Barista could be faster. 3&frac12; Stars. </span><span class="c1">Peter also had a Yelp account with over 150 reviews on cafes all across England. He drank a lot of coffee, hence his upcoming heart attack.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Jeffrey went over to Emily&rsquo;s table and then directed her toward a framed photo from 1970 of Margaret outside the building. To avoid any semantic ambiguity, the photo showed Margaret outside the building, the photo was inside. Margaret kept her framed photos indoors because they last longer that way.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c8">&ldquo;She is very cute,&rdquo; smiled Emily, before emotionally getting back on track. They knew Margaret as she&rsquo;d been giving out donuts the week before.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2"></a></sup></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;She is, I&rsquo;d date her. But look at the windows.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c8">The windows were the same as they appeared now, and to their eyes, each about one metre out of place and out of shape. It was certainly not like this when they came in. Their heads began to whir and spin like an advanced computer solving a complex equation&mdash;or like a ceiling fan. </span><span class="c8 c16">How did the windows change? And when? Contractors aren&rsquo;t exactly known for their quick pace&hellip; </span><span class="c1">They were puzzled to say the least. Of course the answer was very simple: The coffee shop was a nexus between parallel universes.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Chapter 2</span></p><p class="c7 c11"><span class="c5"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Each previous visit to the coffee shop had transported them to a different universe, overriding the consciousness of the Emilies and Jeffreys that were already inhabiting the &lsquo;new&rsquo; universe. &nbsp;Additionally, they vanished from the &lsquo;old&rsquo; universe, ultimately leaving them marked as missing persons. This occurrence was hugely inconvenient for the Margarets, the baristas, Emily&rsquo;s families, Jeffrey&rsquo;s families, and the police forces. It&rsquo;s a lot of paperwork for all involved, and an emotional ordeal for some. Eventually though, the case goes cold and everyone moves on.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">65 years ago the architect was designing the original building that would become the coffee shop. Being a bit old and a bit fed up, he planned to give this building the same treatment he gave all his buildings, including the window formation. But, in their current universe (the one with the different windows) the previous night, the architect&rsquo;s wife initiated a discussion about their stale sex life and how unfulfilled she was. Fresh on his mind, he thought it&#39;d be a nice idea if he mixes things up for once. He firmly decided to give this building different windows, and felt a sense of pride - a feeling he hadn&rsquo;t felt in a long time. Emotionally satisfied, he took no further action on his wife&rsquo;s words. She of course later divorced him. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">In the other universes, she brought it up the following day by which point the designs were finished and windows remained untouched. There was a reason she brought that discussion up early, and there was a reason for that reason, and there was a reason for that reason, and so on and so on. This isn&rsquo;t to say every action causes a massive chain of reactions. Most go cold pretty quick. If someone blinked at a given time or 2 seconds later, it wouldn&rsquo;t change anything significant but it might create a new parallel universe. This means that most universes were basically the same. Normally there were a couple thousand things different across Earth between parallel universes, and most of these were meaningless differences but occasionally some stuck out. Here are some highlights from their previous visits to the coffee shop:</span></p><ul class="c20 lst-kix_khkm4exakjdi-0 start"><li class="c0 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c8">Universe of Visit One (</span><span class="c15">UV1</span><span class="c1">): Average umbrella height was 2% taller than other universes.</span></li><li class="c0 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15">UV2</span><span class="c1">: 17 fake monks robbed a bank in cambodia.</span></li><li class="c0 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15">UV3</span><span class="c1">: At 15:34 27th of May 2005, all six sided dice rolled in that minute landed on the number four.</span></li><li class="c0 c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c15">UV4</span><span class="c8">: Tragically for Peter, who died in all universes, humanity had discovered how to stop all heart attacks using a simple pose the day after his death.</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p class="c0"><span class="c8">They are now in </span><span class="c15">UV5</span><span class="c1">, and as such, information will not be so free-flowing.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c5">Chapter 3</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">By this point, Emily was looking down at her phone, up at the windows, back down at her phone. She had taken a few pictures two weeks prior. &ldquo;Definitely different&mdash;look.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeffrey looked and simultaneously thought that the sunset was nicely framed by the plants and also thought that either he was dreaming, or that reality as he knew it was crumbling apart. Regrettably, it was the latter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emily was now approaching the barista and Jeffrey lamely followed, phone in hand and searching online for the building. There were limited results: mainly Google street view, some unmaintained real estate sites, a couple social media posts, but all had the current windows, and now Jeffery&rsquo;s brain hurt more.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">To Emily&rsquo;s annoyance, there aren&rsquo;t really any social conventions for when you need to question someone about a gross distortion of physics. Most people who do this are either mentally unwell or children of fundamentalist Christians.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hi, erm,&rdquo; said Emily, her hand politely pointing, &ldquo;Do those windows look different to you?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barista slowly turned their head toward Emily&rsquo;s hand and then slowly toward the windows. At this point Jeffrey was beginning to wonder if the barista was a slug after all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, not really, different how?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emily showed them the pictures and explained the situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That. Is. Weird...&rdquo; The barista seemed stunned, although it was hard to tell given their temperament&mdash;they constantly looked stunned. &ldquo;&hellip;I&rsquo;ve never seen the windows look like that.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">The barista eventually showed them similar photos from a few weeks ago with the windows appearing as they stood in the present. They also were a lot less well-taken than Emily&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Emily and Jeffrey thanked them for their time, and returned to their seats. They briefly sat there stuck in the process of thinking without thinking anything at all, before looking at one another. Jeffrey&rsquo;s eyes were a bit wide and a bit crazy. Emily looked mentally fatigued. Both had their blood pulsating.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;This is insanity,&rdquo; said Emily, quietly. It wasn&rsquo;t, what was happening was very real.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Jeffery&rsquo;s crazy-eyes faded as he developed a dejected half-frown. Shaking his head in disbelief, he asked&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go for a walk, would you like to come?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She agreed that it&rsquo;d be good for her, and started placing her things in her rucksack. While she was doing this, Jeffrey consulted Peter who just shrugged, thought him and Emily were mistaken, and got up to buy a fourth coffee. Meanwhile, the barista had concluded that they themselves were in a dream and despite this, continued the rest of their day as normal&mdash;they were quite happy where they were and didn&rsquo;t care for dreams.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One multiversal fact is that humans are very good at rationalising things away and a single degree of separation is oftentimes enough to stop something from occupying the part of the brain that keeps things in check.</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;It causes a lot of needless suffering.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Fuck.&rdquo; Jeffrey muttered as the door shut behind them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Language,&rdquo; said Emily non-seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fuck, fuck fuck, shit fuck,&rdquo; said Jeffrey, also non-seriously.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emily exhaled out of her nose. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly.&rdquo; She paused, though; &lsquo;Fuck&rsquo; was right. &ldquo;...Look, can we talk about something else? Take our minds off it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to&mdash;&rdquo; Jeffrey caught himself and figured it&rsquo;s not a bad idea. He can always spiral later. &ldquo;Ah sure, let&rsquo;s talk about something else. I didn&rsquo;t mean to shoot you down.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No you&rsquo;re okay! Well if it&rsquo;s cool,&rdquo; Emily said, &ldquo;I had this dream a few years ago, that I want to share&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cool,&rdquo; Jeffrey said calmly, although, on the subject of dreams, neither of them still were sure if they were dreaming or not.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c8">&ldquo;Okay so, I was in this room, and suddenly a bunch of buckets appeared, each full of water. There were little holes in the bottom and I had to stop them from draining using this little green watering can I had as a child, but it wasn&rsquo;t big enough; the buckets would keep draining. Then it started to rain, like pouring down, but the buckets still wouldn&rsquo;t fill. I don&rsquo;t really remember how it ended</span><span class="c1">&hellip; and I know I didn&rsquo;t wet the bed before you say that.&rdquo;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Congratulations on the not-wetting-the-bed front. But that does sound like a stressful dream&hellip;&rdquo; Jeffrey couldn&rsquo;t resist making the joke &ldquo;also, I&rsquo;m afraid that it actually means you are secretly in love with your mother.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, wow. I didn&rsquo;t mean to share that with you today,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Too bad&hellip;&rdquo; Jeffery&rsquo;s sarcasm wore off and he became enthusiastic &ldquo;...You know, come to think of it, I actually had a little green watering can as a kid too,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Any dreams about it?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;No, thankfully. I&rsquo;m not a pervert like you. No, yeah, we actually had a little plot in our garden. We would grow things&mdash;my mum and I. I don&rsquo;t remember what though, maybe potatoes? Tomatoes? Burritos? Probably not the last one&hellip; In any case, I liked it alot,&rdquo; Jeffrey&rsquo;s tone became more tentative. &ldquo;But, erm, it sounds like you had a lot on your plate as a kid, maybe?&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3"></a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Firstly, I genuinely love that for you; that&rsquo;s adorable,&rdquo; said Emily, smiling, &ldquo;I used to grow stuff with my little can too! Definitely not burritos though. Secondly, yeah my childhood&mdash;&rdquo;, Emily took a breath and decided she was comfortable sharing; she assumed that&rsquo;s why she brought up the dream. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have much of one. I was the oldest of three girls, my mum wasn&rsquo;t present, and my Dad was kind of useless. Well, at least not as useful as he could have been. I actually kind of resent him, which is annoying because he is sort of nice!&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I see&rdquo;, Jeffery took. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s tricky. Classic men.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c8">&ldquo;Ruining things as always. But yes I did think this dream was childhood related, haha. What about you, surely you want to </span><span class="c1">divulge your childhood issues? It&rsquo;s only fair.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s a bonding exercise&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Exactly&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c8">&ldquo;Well, I had a perfect childhood&mdash;just kidding. Yeah, I was the youngest of five&mdash;&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4"></a></sup></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Wow, so your mum just kept plopping them out?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c8">&ldquo;She sure did!&rdquo; &nbsp;Jeffery then continued, </span><span class="c8">&ldquo;I think being the youngest made me mature quite quickly, which you might relate to? It simultaneously gave me a strong sense of independence (as I was often left doing my own thing) but also gave me a fairly deep need to be liked and accepted&hellip; I&rsquo;m also a child of divorce, as many are, poor me. Throw in the fact that my mum was, let&rsquo;s say&hellip; emotionally inconsistent, and you have an interesting recipe on your hands! I think I&rsquo;m pretty well adjusted though. Anyway, that&rsquo;s my self-imposed psycho-analysis. Was that the detail you were after?&rdquo;</span><sup><a href="#cmnt5" id="cmnt_ref5"></a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt6" id="cmnt_ref6"></a></sup></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">&ldquo;Yes thank you, more than enough.&rdquo; Emily admired his self-awareness. Once again, she paused, then, &ldquo;And yeah, you do seem pretty well adjusted.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Jeffrey smiled. Emily smiled. There was that acceptance he craved. Unfortunately, this sense of approval seemed to always be transient for Jeffrey.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">They were now sitting by the quay on a wooden bench, the wind blowing through them as they sat still. The ducks were making ripples which distorted the orange sunset reflecting off the bluey-greeny water. It was pretty&mdash;cold, but pretty. They had been talking for about 2 hours, featuring some anecdotes, discussing their favourite types of houses, and the occasional poop joke. Things seemed to be winding up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;So what are you going to do now? As in after,&rdquo; Emily said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m overdue a cry. Well, I&rsquo;ll probably go home, do some more googling, and then I&rsquo;ll get to cry. This was nice though,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Good to take our minds off it. But yeah, I&rsquo;ll see what I can find too,&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;With that in mind, the research, can we exchange numbers? You know, if we find anything interesting?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Of course! Plus, it will be helpful if my front door has also shapeshifted and I can&rsquo;t get in.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Perfect.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">They headed back up the hill towards the city and at the particular point where their two routes home diverged, they hugged goodbye.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c29">Chapter 4</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c8">On arriving home, Emily flopped hard onto her bed expecting herself to immediately fall asleep, or maybe even wake up. Neither happened and she just laid there for a bit. Emily lived alone&mdash;although she would have disagreed&mdash;in a one-bed flat above a corner shop with a cat called Henrietta who ate a lot of food and was terrified of the wind. Emily found her living space quite pleasant; there was minimal mould, she kept things mostly tidy, and the warm, low-down lighting made the space feel cosy and lived in&mdash;as did the abundance of cat hair. After looking </span><span class="c8">at her little green watering can on the windowsill, Emily reached for her notebook</span><span class="c1">, a habit from semi-regularly journaling her day. Tonight, though, she had a specific goal in mind. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; While reading through the recent pages, she found the following in an entry from last Tuesday:</span></p><p class="c0 c11 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c12 c8">It&rsquo;s 11pm. Henrietta is sitting at the bottom of my bed begging for food. Stupid cat. I&rsquo;m not going to give her any.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c8 c16">Today was OK. I worked </span><span class="c8 c16">the</span><span class="c8 c12">&nbsp;morning: Tabitha flagged a spike in humidity&mdash;some of our manuscripts were at risk&hellip; I had to temporarily move them to another room, but in the end it got resolved: Tabitha said there was a malfunction in our HVAC&rsquo;s sensor? A bit strange, but a bit exciting.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c8 c16">Went to the coffee shop at 4pm, saw Jeffrey, AGAIN. That&rsquo;s the fourth t</span><span class="c8 c16">ime? I do enjoy seeing him. He&rsquo;s funny, but there&rsquo;s always the chance he&rsquo;s actually an obsessed stalker. I&rsquo;ll probably see him next week&hellip; maybe I&rsquo;m the stalker? The coffee shop was extra special this time though, the owner, Margaret, was giving out donuts.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c12 c8"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">When read, the next eight words nudged something in Emily&rsquo;s brain.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c26"><span class="c12 c8">We spoke, she told me about her cat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">With a metaphorical thud, a memory bifurcated. In her mind, there now existed two distinct interactions for the same event that were equally recallable.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c15">The first way:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Emily and Margaret had a swift but warm exchange. Emily complimented Margaret&rsquo;s shop and then thanked her for the donuts. Margaret made a joke about wishing that donut makers would leave the holes in.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c15">The second way:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;The dialogue expanded beyond a casual conversation. They shared photos of their cats (Margaret was surprisingly with-it when it came to technology), Margaret spoke of her husband&rsquo;s TV channel-changing antics, and reminisced about Margaret&#39;s own experiences at Emily&#39;s age. Emily&rsquo;s face was recognised by Margaret, who revealed she had taught Emily&rsquo;s parents at secondary school. She told Emily that her mum was very intelligent, but her father&hellip; not so much. The journal reflected this second memory.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">Both ways, however, ended with Margaret pointing at Jeffrey saying &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s sweet on you.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, on Jeffrey&rsquo;s turn in the queue, she pointed at Emily, saying &ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s sweet on you.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1">After reading&mdash;and processing the last 6 hours&mdash;Emily reached the conclusion that she wasn&#39;t sure about anything. She did think, however, that speaking to Margaret would be a place to start fixing that.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Less importantly, the journal entry ended like this:</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c8 c16">I&rsquo;ve recently started flossing before bed and every night, I look forward to it&mdash;getting the gunk out of each tooth is probably how pirates felt after raiding an island for treasure, although, I suppose referencing pirates when talking about oral hygiene is a bit insensitive&mdash;as is bringing up &lsquo;sensitivity&rsquo;. Scurvy and whatnot.</span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jeffrey had three housemates all male, but four mixed-gendered housemates if Housemate Number One&rsquo;s girlfriend is counted. Their house was of decent size, though not very well-kept. There was the occasional damp spot and an ever-present chill that seemed to linger throughout the building, so Jeffrey would opt for hot water bottles and blankets to stay warm. On entering home, he was greeted by overhearing some egg-related antics in the kitchen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Helloo,&rdquo; He said, announcing his entrance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What time do you call this, young man?&rdquo; Housemate Number Two poked his head around the door to the kitchen that was a few feet away and perpendicular to the front door.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry Mum&hellip;&rdquo; Jeffrey joked back, half invested. He started walking towards the stairs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;I was worried sick!&rdquo; said Housemate Number Two as Jeffrey&rsquo;s ankles drifted up and out of view, before returning to the kitchen to yell some more about eggs. Jeffrey arrived at his desk, threw on a blanket. He wanted a hot water bottle, but didn&rsquo;t want to operate the kettle in the kitchen. He opened his laptop. </span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c11"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c30 c11"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">Hi James, the 'author', here again&hellip; So from here, the plot would probably go like. 1. After his research, Jeffrey finds some information on margret that suggests she would be good to contact. 2. Jeffrey and Emily text one another at the same time (cute!) to do the same thing:</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">Ping</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">Ping</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">I like this because they have different motivations to do the same thing. They will go speak to Margaret, but first her wife will answer the door, being weird and cryptic about something to do with parallel universes. They tell her to stop being weird and cryptic, and she admits she was weird and cryptic because she didnt actually know much. This is a play on when stories try to hide knowledge from the reader. It&rsquo;s just funny if it turns out that they also don&rsquo;t know. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">Anyway, then they speak to margaret, who somehow reveals the nature of the nexus, but shes not sure why they were here? She would then hook them up to a device, and they discover that (for some reason) their meeting in that coffee shop was extremely improbable (due to their past history, maybe they met before, maybe they both made a distinct choice in that universe, which amplified one another, causing rift). A bit like the probability drive from Hitchhiker&rsquo;s. Once this is discovered, they have to do something to do something else?</span></p><p class="c7 c11"><span class="c10"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c10">I was also thinking that there could be a government program that was invested in this rift, and they take them in for questioning.. Maybe that could be an alternative plot to meeting margaret, instead they are questioned by this government entity. I like the device, but its less compelling because they arent driving the story.
